        "description": "Welcome to London Data Visualization! This Meetup group is for people who are interested in learning more about graph visualization, layout, and analysis. Graphs are a fundamental data structure that is used to manage relational information, and they are useful in many application areas such as network topology, link analysis, schematics and models, and in processes, dependencies and flows. Join our Meetup to learn more about a variety of interesting topics including advanced web, desktop, and mobile presentation services for graph interaction and exploration. Learn more about topics of interactive diagramming, advanced geometric work on graph layout, labeling, and routing, and interesting graph analysis methods. In some sessions, we will demonstrate graph visualization systems that are built over many years, and designed to meet discerning industry requirements. We will also regularly feature industry experts, including developers showcasing their production applications, leading professors and students sharing their research, and guest speakers giving talks in specific related fields. The amount of data around us is growing quickly, and more and more, individuals and organizations are relying on graph visualization and analysis to help them discover patterns and hidden relationships within their data. Stay up to date with the latest trends in the visualization field. Join us to learn more, meet new friends, and enjoy a few cocktails!",

GRAKN.AI is a hyper-relational database that allows you to perform knowledge engineering to manage this complexity. Effectively, Grakn provides a Knowledge Base (aka. Knowledge Graph) as the core foundation of intelligent systems.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Grakn provides an intelligent query language, Graql: Grakn\u2019s reasoning (through OLTP) and analytics (through OLAP) query language, which is a much higher-level abstraction over traditional query languages. This allows intelligent systems to benefit from an intuitive language the provides&nbsp;an expressive schema for knowledge modelling, reasoning transactions for real-time inference, distributed algorithms for large-scale analytics, and optimisation of query execution. Grakn also provides the logical integrity of SQL, the scale of relationships of Graph databases, and the horizontal scalability of NoSQL. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>In this community, we discuss the underlying technology and applications of the Grakn hyper-relational database. We will also discuss the techniques of a new software engineering principle, Knowledge-Driven Development, that Grakn now enables.

We meet to find out the latest goings on with the Pentaho stack, and also to discuss and learn about related technologies. Learning what other users are doing with the product also becomes a great source of inspiration for all. The Pentaho community in London is also growing rapidly (partly fuelled by the rise in Big Data) so come down and make some new contacts. Our events are deliberately kept technically oriented and are not places where you will be accosted by sales people!</p>",

In 2015 more than 30 thought provoking events were organized by EntAnon and B.U.I.L.D (that is at least one event every second week) engaging thousands of members. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The name Entrepreneurs Anonymous could stand for being addicted to Entrepreneurship and having an urgent need to get group support for it. But actually Entrepreneurs Anonymous is more about providing a safe place with like-minded people where entrepreneurship can be explored. Here Entrepreneurs-to-be and undercover entrepreneurs from corporates have been spotted too.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Entrepreneurs Anonymous events started in Dublin, Ireland in 2011 as accountability group by former students of an entrepreneurship course. The interest for the group grew and now social events with guest speakers are organized every last Tuesday of the month. With a membership increase by 10% each month it was quickly realized last Tuesday-events were simply just not enough for the Anonymous Entrepreneurs.</p>\n<p>B.U.I.L.D&nbsp;was set up to offer more opportunities for Entrepreneurs to learn from each other. So far&nbsp;B.U.I.L.D&nbsp;events like the Gigonomy Panel discussion, Speed Business Networking and the Free Business Clinic have been organized. B.U.I.L.D also organizes former DDM events. These are events for people especially interested in Data Driven Marketing.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>More about B.U.I.L.D and DDM Alliance</b></p>\n<p>EntAnon's brand&nbsp;\u200b\u200bB.U.I.L.D partnered&nbsp;\u200b with the former Data Driven Marketing Alliance (DDM). Future \u200bDDM&nbsp;\u200bmeetups and other events in Copenhagen, Berlin, Belgium, Dublin,&nbsp;Dusseldorf, Helsinki, London, Manchester, Netherlands, Paris,&nbsp;Stockholm, \u200bsoon \u200bMilano\u200b and other parts of Europe will be organized together with B.U.I.L.D.

Our members stick around after the talk, and it's a great place to chat to other like-minded individuals working in this space in London.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We've so far been hosted in the Shard, the 250 year old Lloyds Register building, and the British Library. Topics to date have included a Bayes ranking system in Halo (TrueSkill), the convergence of deep learning and Bayesian approaches, and how to apply Belief networks to the real world, and we've had talks from Amazon, UCL and the University of Oxford.</p>",

Each meetup typically showcases several Looker implementations at businesses (like yours?) that rely on data to succeed. Users present a specific use case, an interesting path to insights, or maybe an overview of Looker adoption throughout the organization. It\u2019s also a good time to eat, drink, and network with others who are using Looker to explore data. You will get the address to the next Meetup, after you become a member.

Computer-based information processing&nbsp; is now a practical reality that is ubiquitous and pervasive in so many things that we do today. Nevertheless the power of computing largely remains implicit, unappreciated and even misunderstood to the most.</p>\n<p>We are at the dawn of Cognitive Computing. Where the power of information processing meets highly adaptive cognitive algorithms and vast data sets and sensor inputs about all aspects of our lives. The destiny is limited by our capacity to imagine and harness this vast potential underneath man-machine-data interaction.</p>\n<p>In this meet up, we will discuss about the trends in computing; around predictive analytics, machine learning techniques that utilizes large and disparate data sets and about emerging platforms that support all these, for example, IBM Bluemix. And we will roll up our sleeves and start working on some practical examples and contribute to the community. <br></p>\n<p> <br></p>",

But the big data element have taken a massive leap forward with it being the first tool to support spark and spark streaming natively. We would love to have a meetup to share ideas and stories about how to get the best out Talend (open source and enterprise) and how to really get into the new area of Spark. We'll meet once a month in Holborn as its so central - downstairs bar at XXXX - 5.30 - 8pm. Key thing is to meet people, share ideas, learn new things and have a few beers while doing it.</p>",

At the beginning, there is a tutorial on different aspects of building an app. Subsequently, you can implement what you just learned on your laptop and ask the organising team any questions if you run into problems.</p> \n<p>2) Presentation</p> \n<p>We invite speakers to present on cutting edge tech research that affects developers. The topics revolve around artificial intelligence, big data, server operations, and internet of things.</p> \n<p>3) Hackathon</p> \n<p>We have a one day hackathon on Saturdays where you can delve more deeply into building projects. You are free to bring a side project or work on a new one with other participants. You are encouraged to implement what you have learned at the workshops and presentations.</p> \n<p>Please make sure to sign up for these events as soon as they are announced as places fill up quite fast. &lt;br&gt;</p> \n<p>Join our slack channel (gdgcloud.slack.com) to have a chat with the community. To get an invite, send an email to slack@gdgcloud.com &lt;br&gt;</p> \n<p>And hope to see you in person at one of the events!</p>",

We`ll present our biased view, we`ll be informal, we might even be incorrect and a bit controversial BUT we`ll try not to be boring and we will focus on the important stuff. I promise we'll be frank and we will show you how to get your DG initiative off the ground.</p>",

If you haven't been before and want to get a flavour of our meetups, might I suggest having a look at the following two meetups:</p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/central_london_data_science/events/242643427/\">Python Intro, Anaconda, Jupyter Notebooks and all that jazz</a>&nbsp;- <a href=\"https://github.com/central-ldn-data-sci/Anaconda_python_intro\">Github Repository</a></p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/central_london_data_science/events/243445481/\">Lets do Clustering! (Unsupervised machine learning) theory + practical!</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/central-ldn-data-sci/CLDSPN-lets-do-clustering\">Github Repository</a></p>\n<p>The first meetup is a good introduction for anyone new to python, and introduces Anaconda and is a good place to start. If you have worked your way through this tutorial you will find the meetups easier to get to grips with.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The second meetup is an an excellent example of our meetups, where a topic or set of skills is introduced before demonstrating how they can be applied in python.

        "description": "It's been a long time, almost 40 years, since Gifford Pinchot III coined the term of \"Intrapreneur\". Today we assist to a myriad of startups trying to get traction, led by entrepreneurs following the path of Lean Startup. They follow a big idea with courage enough to at least try once. Some others just don't have the proper support for whatever reason to give it a try, just because life is too hard. Intrapreneurs dream becoming Entrepreneurs but don't know how yet, or just the opposite, no longer have enough energy because they already tried and failed, so need stability within a company, until they can start over. Companies today need talent for innovation, which comes from endeavour for sustainable competitive advantage. If you have the attitude of an entrepreneur but still need stability, or just you enjoy innovating within your company, this is your meetup group. We'll share theory, practice and ideas. Get inspired!.",

Rather it is the challenge, exploration, discovery and resolution of problems that provides the impetus.</p> \n<p>We are analysts for whom the simpler the solution the better. Those who seek to simplify, but no further than justifiable. Who don't hid behind complication, who would rather be approximately right than accurately wrong. Who see particular software solutions or methods as part of a tool-set rather than badges of honour. For whom the priority is focusing on solving the problems to hand, within the constraints that apply with creativity and innovation.</p>",

The blockchain was the brainchild of Satoshi Nakamoto and was originally devised for the digital currency, Bitcoin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But since then, it has evolved into more than just Bitcoin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cryptocurrencies, and Ethereum - if you are keeping up with the news or on any social media, you must have heard about these terms. The blockchain is the idea that drives these innovations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Although the exploitation of blockchain-enabled applications is just at the beginning, the trend is already obvious and visible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The blockchain technology has the enormous potential to disrupt many industries.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, blockchains have major technical barriers (e.g. limited scalability, privacy, and inadequate tooling) that make them impractical for mainstream uses.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If we are able to overcome these challenges, the blockchain technology has the ability to make the world more transparent, democratic, decentralized and secure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you are excited about the potential of the technology, join us on this journey as we invite blockchain innovators to share how we will change the world together.</p>",

Although the manipulation and analysis of data can be quite technical, the Meetups will cover topics at a level suitable for anyone who wants to reflect on data and how it is eating the world.</p>",

Talend specialises in Big Data applications. The software platform is used in many cloud, data integration, data management, data quality, data preparation, application integration and migration projects.</p>\n<p>We want to bring together all you Talend enthusiasts every few months and would love to start a forum to discuss best practises on the Talend platform, provide some real life use cases into how you can use Talend to build successful data projects and give organisations the flexibility they need to become truly data-driven. Location will most probably be in Central London, somewhere nice and easy to get too and always a few beers and pizza at hand!</p>\n<p>Look forward to seeing you join us at our future Meetups!</p>",

We will cover strategy with a focus on enterprise digital which will include subcategories such as devops, cloud, cybersecurity, agile software engineering,machine learning, lean product development, internet of things ,web, mobile and of course how to improve return on investment using technology.</p> \n<p>Our recent popular post : <a href=\"https://www.logicroom.co/no-one-understands-digital-transformation-heres-why/\">https://www.logicroom.co/no-one-understands-digital-transformation-heres-why/</a></p> \n<p>The group is not about technology as a primary focus, we will be looking at the strategy and execution of business and how technology helps us get there. We will be particularly interested in hearing from people that are using technology to get real results. We also want to hear about failures and pitfalls.</p> \n<p>We all know technology is a bit of a racket, so lets explore how to get our transformation done without blowing our budgets and putting our projects at risk with shiny new tech stuff!</p> \n<p>&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;</p>",

        "description": "<p>On the 4th May 2017 we are presenting an amazing keynote presentation, Archive Storage Technologies and Trends: Dr April Alstrin is currently the Director of Oracle\u2019s Enterprise Tape Drive Engineering group based in Broomfield, Colorado. She played an instrumental lead in the design and development of Oracle\u2019s industry leading enterprise drives including the T10000C and T10000D as well as in the introduction of the first Barium Ferrite magnetic tape for high capacity storage. She served as the Technology Team Lead for the most recent Information Storage Industry Consortium \u2018s (INSIC) 2015-2025 tape storage roadmap. With a PhD in physical chemistry from the University of Colorado-Boulder, April began her career in the hard disk drive industry as a process engineer designing and manufacturing recording heads. Through an acquisition, April entered the world of magnetic tape storage. Finding that recording heads were often blamed for drive problems, she switched to the other popular scapegoat for issues, the tape cartridge and media development. As her career progressed and acquisitions occurred (StorageTek to Sun Microsystems to Oracle), she gained responsibilities for the magnetic recording group and then the entire tape drive development organization. With more than 20 years of experience in storage technologies, she enjoys advocating for tape as part of a storage solution.</p>",

For years we've seen what the future might look like via sexy sci-fi films--well now the future is here and it's our turn to make that vision a reality! Join us in sharing our coding knowledge and let's develop ideas together over pizza and beer!</p>\n<p>Are you working on a website, mobile web app, or designing a game? What are some of the challenges you\u2019ve encountered that you will need to overcome in order to finish the project? Did you just have a breakthrough moment and would like to share it with the rest of the group? Maybe you\u2019re looking for collaborators or just feedback from fellow hackers?</p>\n<p>With a strong emphasis on best practices and problem-solving, this HTML5 meetup series aims at inviting developers to demo projects and interact with an audience of fellow programmers. The goal is to get your questions answered!&nbsp; We will bring at least one expert speaker on board per session, but we want to keep this meetup really developer-centric.</p>\n<p>Everyone is welcome to present at the next CodeShow as long as it's HTML5 related - we only ask you to keep it within 5-7 minutes and to let us know in advance if you wish to present (via personal message or in the comments)</p>\n<p>This fun geek event will be as good as we all make it! Bring your hacks and your friends and join us for a night of html5 and its CSS3/javascript/flash/.etc friends!</p>\n<p>Look forward to seeing you all there!</p>",

The aim is to hold meetups where real-life experiences of using KNIME are aired, new developments in KNIME are explained with some deep dives into KNIME capabilities. As an open analytics platform, KNIME can work with R, WEKA and many other tools - the interoperability of KNIME will also be covered. The objective is to build a connected community of KNIME users and all those interested in analytics. Join up, and find out who else is interested in KNIME. Meetups will initially be held in London. If there is enough interest, we hope to have additional meetups in other parts of the UK. If you have a story around KNIME or analytics - please contact us.</p>\n<p><br>\n\n</p>\n<br>",

As companies are becoming more and more agile, and see how they can now adapt in order to innovate and compete faster than their competition, software development teams are being forced to maintain and evolve large, monolithic applications at a pace of change that those architectures were never meant to withstand, let alone embrace!</span> <br></p>\n<p>Microservices are a new approach to architecting applications. They are simple, single-purpose, lightweight architectural components that enable you to deliver software faster. The microservice architectural approach also aims to lead to software that thrives on change while at the same time being secure, performant, and stable.</p>\n<p>This meet up is for people interested in architecting, designing, deploying and maintaining micro service based software architectures.</p>\n<p>If you want to advertise jobs to the user group, read our policy here&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/London-Microservices-User-Group/pages/Posting_Jobs_to_the_User_Group/\">http://www.meetup.com/London-Microservices-User-Group/pages/Posting_Jobs_to_the_User_Group/</a></p>\n<p>Follow us on twitter -&gt;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/microservicesUG\">https://twitter.com/microservicesUG</a></p>\n<p>Got a talk?

        "description": "<p>Welcome to the complexity meetup. This is a place for all people interested in complexity issues to meet and share insights about complexity, systems thinking and holistic approaches to complex challenges. The human brain, ecosystems, economies and social networks are all great examples of complex systems as they have many parts interconnected with each other without central control or design and exhibit subtle and unpredictable behavior.</p>\n<p>We all experience a complex, interconnected&nbsp; and holistic world so everyone interested is very welcome to join. <br></p>\n<p>Complexity based thinking challenges many assumptions about the world, for example:</p>\n<p>1.&nbsp; A system can be fully understood</p>\n<p>2.&nbsp; The components of a system can be analyzed, and by adding together all the components we understand the behavior of the whole</p>\n<p>3.&nbsp; The behavior of a system can be predicted</p>\n<p>4.&nbsp; The outputs of a system will be proportional to the inputs</p>\n<p>5.&nbsp; The system can be understood isolated from the environment, ignoring the interconnections with other systems.</p>\n<p>6.&nbsp; Events have a single cause that can be isolated.</p>\n<p>7.&nbsp; Unintended consequences are the rule rather than the exception. Expect unintended consequences to any attempts to make improvements, and be prepared to make changes to take account of the unintended consequences,.</p>\n<p>8.&nbsp; Complex systems have paradoxical behavior. The definition of a complex system is unclear. They evolve and stay the same, some behavior is predictable e.g. adaptation to the environment and other behaviour is unpredictable <br></p>\n<p>9. The examples above are over-simplifications and will not apply in all cases, complexity itself is complex so these are just some viewpoints. <br></p>\n<p>By studying complex systems we hope to become more holistic and interconnected in our thinking about the world. This alternative viewpoint may contribute to being able to make improvements in complex ecological, social and economic issues or to grow organizations in challenging environments. </p>\n<p>I hope that by popularizing insights from complexity research, this shared understanding will help people trying to make big improvements in the world to become more effective.</p>\n<p> Another goal is that by aligning your thinking and beliefs with the behavior of complex systems, you will become more aligned with how complex systems operate e.g. your own behavior, social groups, organizations, ecosystems. Hopefully then you will be less surprised by what happens, and less emotionally attached to outcomes that cannot be controlled, and better able to flourish amid uncertainty and change.</p>\n<br>",

As a result London Python Project Nights was born.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>We welcome any</span>one who has a <span>project idea they would like to work on, or looking for a project to contribute to. We have had people come to start a new project, people working on their existing project, people joining those of other attendees, even people coming to work al</span>one on large well-<span>known open source products.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>We do not enforce a minimum level of coding ability, but we do expect every</span>one to contribute on <span>some level, and have a code of conduct we expect attendees to adhere to (</span><a href=\"http://london-python-project-nights.github.io/code-of-conduct\" class=\"linkified\">http://london-python-project-nights.github.io/code-of-con...</a><span>). This is intended to make the event as inclusive as possible, and suggestions for ways we can improve are welcome.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span><b>TL;TR&nbsp;</b></span></p>\n<p><span>In summary we're all about code, every</span>one is welcome<span>, bring your own food and drink, work on whatever you want, as long as you're willing to talk people through what you've d</span>one at the end<span>. To keep in contact between events we have set up&nbsp;<a href=\"http://ldnpyprj.slack.com\">ldnpyprj.slack.com</a> - anyone on gmail or hotmail should be able to sign up without an invite, let us know if you want to join but can't.</span></p>",

From medical devices to EEG consumer devices like the InteraXon's Muse, the OpenBCI board, the Emotiv's EPOC & Insight, the Neurosky's Mindwave we'll talk about 'reading' the brain. What about 'writing' the brain ? tDCS, TMS, DBS, ... Thync, Foc.us, ...</p>\n<p>Why not talk about NeuroEthics ? Should we 'zap' our brains ? Drugs can be smart ? Can they make me smarter ?</p>\n<p>From Hackers to Researchers we want to provide a framework that will catalyze the growth of the NeuroTech enthusiasts network. We want to raise awareness and engage with people outside these fields that have no idea what's going on in the field of neurotechnology. (If you didn't understand anything described above, but are curious, join us.)</p>\n<p>Because each city should have it's own personal NeuroTech community and connect with other NeuroTechX nodes around the world !</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Join the conversation on\u00a0<a href=\"https://neurotechx.herokuapp.com/\">Slack</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/NeuroTechX/\">Facebook</a>\u00a0 & <a href=\"https://twitter.com/neurotechx\">Twitter</a> and play an active role in the future of DIY NeuroTech.

Following the success of the initial&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/HumanOps-London/events/229460050/\">HumanOps London meetup in May 2016</a>, we decided to run another one in&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/HumanOps-SanFrancisco/events/231558901/\">San Francisco in June 2016</a>. With speakers from Spotify, Yelp, PagerDuty, Server Density and other companies doing interesting things around ops, we hosted 3-4 short presentations followed by chats.</p>\n<p>We hope to run 2-3 events a year so stay tuned to this group to hear when the next one is announced.</p>\n<p><b>Want to run your own HumanOps event?</b></p>\n<p>We'd love to hear from you if you're interested in running a local event. We have 3 requirements: 1) You must have a clearly published code of conduct. 2) No vendor talks. 3) You should aim for a diverse set of speakers.&nbsp;<a>Just get in touch</a>.</p>",

The goal is to make this event series a non-coding event, we'll keep the command line magic to the bare minimum. There are enough other meetups that focus on the development side of APIs.</span><br></p>\n<p><span>We try to record and then publish the presentations/talks so those unable to attend can also benefit.

Clojure is a powerful, productive and fun language, based on LISP and hosted on Java, JavaScript and Microsoft CLR. Due to its simple syntax, Clojure is a great way to learn functional programming. London Clojurians is a very active community with several events per month, including technical talks, coding dojo's, hackdays and a yearly conference. We hope you will join us and increase your knowledge and appreciation of Clojure and add your own experiences to our community.",

Please be sure to familiarise yourself with <a href=\"https://linuxinginlondon.wordpress.com/code-of-conduct-2017/\">our code of conduct. </a></p>\n<p>Everyday we use Linux and open source software without even knowing it. It powers Google, Facebook, Docker and most of the Internet infrastructure. Without Linux and open source the world would not be as connected as it is, or look as it does.</p>\n<p>In this modern age the development of open source software and Linux is striking. It is changing every week, there are new products coming out, almost at the speed of light. We feel there needs to be a tangible and friendly space to discuss those developments and learn from each other, that isn\u2019t the pub or dominated by men.<br></p>\n<p>Our objectives:</p>\n<p>\u2022 to provide a safe and friendly environment where people can come together, talk and be informed about free and open source software.</p>\n<p>\u2022 to hold regular presentations from open source specialists on everything from the Linux kernel, the command line to Linux in the Cloud, and much more.</p>\n<p>\u2022 encourage everyone to talk about and to use free and open source software.&nbsp; We are Linux distribution agnostic, we like BSD and all derivatives too!</p>\n<p><b>All of our events are free to participants.</b></p>\n<p>We are committed to a non-profit ethos and make a real effort to address the gender imbalance in technology. Women get ticketing priority at all Linuxing In London events.<br></p>\n<p>We meet at London's premier technology venue, Skills Matter, every month.<br></p>\n<p>But if you have any ideas, suggestions for topics or sponsorship (someone to pay for the soft drinks and nibbles!) please contact us.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Brian Byrne and David Ross</p>\n<p>Last edited June 2017.<br></p>\n<br>",

We started this journey back in August 2014 when <b>AngularJS Meetup Waterloo</b>&nbsp;was founded and meetings where held on a public cafe. After that it was&nbsp;<b>AngularLabs</b>. Our first sponsors joined bringing a new venue and catering. Meetings became very popular so we had to move to a bigger venue and take in more sponsors. During that time I became an <b>Angular Google Developer Expert </b>and started travelling to conferences and running workshops all over the world.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Many things have changed so we decided to use all our new experiences to create <b>AngularZone</b>. Hope you like it!</p>",

A local chapter of <a href=\"http://rladies.org\">R-Ladies Global</a>, R-Ladies London exists to promote gender diversity in the R community, both in the UK and worldwide.&nbsp;We are pro-actively inclusive of queer, trans, and all minority identities, with additional sensitivity to intersectional identities (which many lead R-Ladies are) - our priority is to provide a safe community space for anyone identifying as a minority gender who is interested in and/or working with R. As a founding principle, there is no cost or charge to participate in any of our R-Ladies communities around the world.</p>\n<p>R-Ladies London welcomes members of all R proficiency levels, whether you're a new or aspiring R user, or an experienced R programmer interested in mentoring, networking &amp; expert upskilling. Our non-profit, civil society community is designed to develop our members' R skills &amp; knowledge through social, collaborative learning &amp; sharing. Supporting<span>&nbsp;minority identity access to STEM skills &amp; careers, the Free Software Movement, and contributing to the global R community!&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>@RLadiesLondon | london@rladies.org (email)</span></p>\n<p><span>@RLadiesGlobal | info@rladies.org (email) |&nbsp;</span><span>rladies.org (website) | github.com/rladies</span></p>\n<p><i><b>PS&nbsp;Community Policies &amp; Code of Conduct</b>: the leadership, mentoring &amp; teaching roles within this Community are held exclusively by minority genders (majority gender speakers may be allowed/invited as one-off guests in exceptional circumstances at the leadership team's discretion). Due to unexpected demand, we have opened learning participation to all genders, dependent on initial and on-going vetting by the leadership team. However, the stated priority of the R-Ladies communities is the development &amp; support specifically of those identifying as a minority gender, and we therefore reserve the right to guard this interest through whatever measures the leadership team deem appropriate. Anyone involved with R-Ladies London is expected to fully respect each other, the mandate of this community, and the goodwill on which R-Ladies is founded, or face expulsion/a penalty of any form, at the discretion of the leadership team.&nbsp;</i> <br></p>\n<p>Full community guidelines are found here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki/Code-of-Conduct\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki...</a></p>\n<p><i><b>PPS Photos, Films and all other media/recordings</b>: photographs and/or video/other media will be taken at events held by this community.

Compliance with the new requirements has become a key consideration for organisations that process personal data.</p>\n<p>We host events that are opportunities to discuss the GDPR in detail. For example: <br>&nbsp; - What do we know / don't know about the regulation? <br>&nbsp; - How does it apply to our organisations? <br>&nbsp; - What do organisations have to do differently than they might have done in the past?<span> <br></span><span>&nbsp; - What practical steps should an organisation take on the journey towards compliance? <br></span><span>&nbsp; - What is the impact of Brexit?</span></p>\n<p>General sessions may start with a broad introduction, followed by focused small group discussions that focus in on the key issues and discussion points. Deep dives cover specific GDPR-related topics of interest to our members. </p>\n<br>",

We want to build a community where we discuss Industry Trends, Best Practices and anything else regarding Cloud Data Management! To grow our community we are going to kick off a series of technical workshops with presenters from all corners of Rubrik and our Partners - we like to call these BrewBrik events where we can chat in a comfortable setting with Pizza &amp; beer (soft drinks also provided!)&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>Join Chris Wahl, Chief Technologist, in Rubrik\u2019s first technical workshop, as he walks through using Rubrik\u2019s RESTful APIs to easily put together backup validation workflows that take seconds to complete.</span><br></p>\n<p>In this workshop, you will:</p>\n<p>Be introduced to Rubrik\u2019s incredibly powerful RESTful API with live demonstrations, code examples, and real workflows.</p>\n<p>Learn how you can leverage your existing orchestration engines to build, test, and validate that your data can truly be restored.</p>\n<p>Add data restoration workflows to your Continuous Integration and Delivery (CI/CD) pipelines to completely treat infrastructure as code.</p>\n<p>More of these workshops will follow all around the UK. We are interested in what you want to learn about so please offer your opinions!!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thanks,</p>\n<p>Justine&nbsp;</p>",

        "description": "<p>Are you interested in data and charities?</p> \n<p>SoGive is building the only comprehensive database of charity impact, taking data from the public domain and amalgamating it. This will help donors to take a data-driven approach to making charitable donation decisions.</p> \n<p>We hold events on the first and third Saturday of the month where people get together and gather/analyse charity data together.</p> \n<p>WHAT HAPPENS AT THE EVENT?<br>The session will start with a run-through of the charity analysis approach used by SoGive, given by Sanjay. We will then go ahead and analyse several charities. WHY WOULD I WANT TO ATTEND?<br>This will be a great opportunity for people who want any of the following:<br>*** to get to know more about the assessment of charity impact<br>*** to know more about what's happening in the charity sector<br>*** to contribute to an exciting project that may influence a huge number of people with their charitable giving<br>*** anyone who is planning to move into the charity sector/apply for a job there would find this would gain a real edge from this training</p> \n<p>SOME PRACTICALITIES<br>- Please bring a laptop (or other device that you can work from)<br>- Arriving late or leaving early are absolutely fine (but if you can arrive on time that would be good if it's your first time, since there will be an intro at the start)<br>- SoGive will cover the costs of teas or coffees bought at the venue (relevant for events held in a cafe)</p> \n<p>If you need to get in touch (e.g. for help with finding the venue) you can call me on 07962 817097</p> \n<p>MORE QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE<br>-- What skills do I need?<br>Ability to read, understand, and interpret information about charities. No need to be able to code, although familiarity with spreadsheets is useful</p> \n<p>-- Will I do very in depth charity analysis?<br>SoGive aims to be broad and cover lots of charities, rather than go into things in depth.</p> \n<p>-- Do I have to attend in person?<br>This is easiest to do if you're London-based and can come to the venue, although we have accommodated people participating remotely as well. Best to say something in advance if you want to do this.</p>",

We all know that data has the potential to transform how projects, programmes and portfolios are delivered, but practical implementation constraints often prevent the full value from being realised. This meetup will explore some of the challenges at the intersection of data analysis and project, programme and portfolio management and discuss how practitioners are working to resolve them, underpinned by real world examples.</p>\n<p>We'll also explore how machine learning and AI can help to resolve some of the challenges at the intersection of project / programme management and big data.</p>",

        "description": "This is a group for those people who spend their days working behind the scenes of the Salesforce setup menu to configure, customise and extend the functionality of Salesforce business applications. Whether you are a member of an in-house team or employed as an external consultant, we all have something in common. That is, keeping up to date with a continually evolving platform and the need to learn and share our experiences of best practice. Those who are not new to the world of Salesforce already know, understand, and often preach WHY Salesforce cloud benefits the businesses which use it. The aim of this group is to bring people together to talk HOW to get the job done and deliver those benefits. The word used to identify people who carry out these tasks on the Salesforce platform is \"admin\", but as we all know there are many many different roles which sit behind the label. This group is a place for us all to gather, whether the majority of our time is spent on end-user support, or business analysis, or responding to business change that needs additional validation and workflows to be created, or integrating with different platforms using 3rd party tools, the list goes on and on. There is already a strong Salesforce community centred around London, this group aims to serve the needs of Salesforce admins in particular by providing a place to meet face-to-face and build new relationships, share personal experiences and see hands-on examples of Salesforce configuration techniques using all the features. The group will welcome members who are new to the world of Salesforce, or who may be considering in becoming a Salesforce admin in the future. We're going to need more people in order to build all these business applications in the cloud! Welcome #awesomeadmin!",

They get a chance to showcase their code to each other, discuss ways of working with code, and maybe even write a bit of code. After 15 minutes, the coders rotate and are paired with a new coder. <br></p>\n<p>This gives coders an efficient way to see which coders they want to collaborate with further in a hackathon or otherwise.

Then this is the Meetup group for you! It doesn't matter if you are a permanent employee, day rate contractor, working as a Programme Director or Junior Developer, we all have something in common and would love to hear your opinion!</p>\n<p> <br></p>\n<p>There is a strong professional CRM community in London with no real recurring event to give everyone the opportunity to meet. This group aims to serve the needs of all CRM professionals in particular by providing a place to meet face-to-face, exchange some of the latest ideas and chat it all our over a few drinks/snacks with new friends.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Unlike the large corporate events that are run purely for the benefit of that particular CRM system (such as the Salesforce World Tour), this event aims to be unbiased and instead welcomes all different types of systems, topics, speakers and point of views surrounding CRM. We believe this approach will create a truly open and helpful forum that everyone should be able to take something away from.</p>\n<p><span> <br></span></p>\n<p><span>This community is driven by its members for the benefit of its members.&nbsp; So if you want to speak about projects you have worked on, want to host a meeting, tell people about blogs you have written or whatever it might be, then do send a message to Jack.Holmes@lafosse.com to arrange!</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LondonCRM\">https://twitter.com/LondonCRM</a></p>",

        "description": "<p>Microservices architecture (MSA) is about developing a software application as a suite of granular and independent services that are designed, developed, deployed and running independently. Microservices are exposed to the consumers via API Management layer as managed APIs. Often microservices are built as fine-grained units, but real world use cases require the composition of microservices and other monolithic systems. That's where the 'integration' of microservices becomes a vital factor.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The main objective of this meetup is to\u00a0unveil\u00a0the hype from the reality of Microservices and discuss the pragmatic\u00a0microservices\u00a0architecture alongside API Managment,\u00a0integration, security and analytics technologies.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Feel free to ask questions or jump in with ideas and new topics for discussions !</p>",

Amazon Business Pro (#ABPro) is a support group for people selling on Amazon. You want to quit the day job, or have possibly already done that. You have made the investment in either time or money, but you need that all-important mind shift to succeed. You need to think of yourself as a business that operates through Amazon and so you need to think as a fully fledged business. Join whether you are FBM, FBA, Online Arbitrage, Private Label, Reseller, beginner, intermediate, or expert level. Together we stand.</p> \n<p>As a pro seller, there are many ducks to get in a row: your strategy, your social media and influencer networks, taxes, legal structures and hiring talent that can take your business to the next level. This group is for those who are serious about making a real go of their business. Learn how to transform and troubleshoot declining sales. Learn how to recruit heavy-weight resources that can help you transform your business through recommendation, learn from mistakes others have made and share and motivate others by sharing your successes.

        "description": "<p>SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT: alongside mining I am actively&nbsp;brainstorming to develop applications on the blockchain. I welcome developers, engineers, visionaire, entrepreneurs and investors to come and discuss ideas and opportunities. Looking for business partners who wants to move quickly in this new startup with equal shares and resources/time invested into it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Interested on joining forces? You don't have to wait for the Meetup, message me and we can meet the same day.</p>\n<p>MINING: Thinking of buying&nbsp;mining rigs? Or perhaps buying into online mining contracts? Join this Meetup before spending any money.</p>\n<p>If you are reading / thinking of joining this meetup, you have, at some point, thought about start mining a cryptocurrency or at least heard of it and curios what is all the heap about.</p>\n<p>Mining is not dead, in fact is very much alive despite what everyone say.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Popular Q&amp;A&nbsp; <br>. Where should you start? At this meetup&nbsp; <br>. Will it work? (Mining..) YES&nbsp; <br>. Is it (still) profitable? Yeees!&nbsp; <br>. Do I need a lot of money? At least \u00a33000 to make it worthwhile&nbsp; <br>. Is the investment secure? Is one of the most secure investments you'll ever make&nbsp; <br>. What returns should I expect? It vary but it could be well over 100% per year, ~30% worst case scenario. Yes, there is a huge difference between the two; welcome to the cryptocurrency world! Think about how much time / effort it takes to get even 1% from any investment (think trading, banking, not to mention that most businesses have an end of year net profits of 7% to 15%) unless you deal with drugs, there isn't anything else out there this consistent, safe &amp; profitable.&nbsp; <br>. Is it legal? Yes, 100%. The UK (HMRC) treat any cryptocurrency as any other currency since 2014&nbsp; <br>. Are profits from mining taxable? Yes, if you declare them. Have you ever traded online? Did you report gains/profits/losses to the HMRC? Mining follow the same concept. As a company is obviously more profitable to declare rent, capital expenses, running costs and gains.&nbsp; <br>. What do I need to do to maintain the rigs? Absolutely nothing, or at least that's the goal. Like a car, it need a MOT once on a while (dust spray the graphic cards radiators/fans) and it can be done with a \u00a32 compressed air canister you can find at any computer / DIY store. Checking your profits and making sure is all going as it should, once on a day, is not a bad idea either. And if you have lots of mining rigs, you will already have some idea of what it takes to maintain a server room or will get a crash course on it :)</p>\n<p>If you are serious about mining, this meetup is where your worries will rest.</p>\n<p>With dozens of happy customers and 100's of mining rigs installed all over the UK, you are in good hands; in fact there are very few good hands in UK that does this professionally.</p>\n<p>Have been building mining rigs for more than a year and continue to do it as my main and only job through own company. <br>Months of research and thousands of pounds went into it (including: server grade graphic card like the Firepro S1950, Intel 6900K, 12 cores Intel Xeon processor, R9 Nano &amp; GTX 1080 Ti mining rigs etc)&nbsp; <br>Own &amp; successfully run a \"small\" mining farm in Central London.</p>\n<p>There will be no hard selling, the Meetup will be very relaxed and anyone is welcome to talk to each other.</p>\n<p>Is not late to start, is never too late! In fact this is just the infancy of cryptocurrencies and the perfect time to start!</p>\n<p>Come and join me, and get all of your question answered (or at least most of them!)</p>\n<p>PS: do not expect to be taught how to build a mining rig or fix one (if you are in either situation it means you haven't done your homework properly.. no one can do that for you)</p>\n<p>Who should join this meetup:&nbsp; <br>- people with at least \u00a33000 to invest | any less and it won't be worthwhile.&nbsp; <br>- those \u00a33000+ must not be your only savings | mining is for the long term; investing into equipments with your last resources is never a good idea.&nbsp; <br>- investors or company's owners with taxable earnings / profits on financial year's end | companies or individual in the higher tax brackets have huge advantages when buying / running a mining farm.&nbsp; <br>- people with a good / excellent credit rating | most people don't even blink when they have to buy a \u00a320K car.. how about opening a loan to invest into crypto mining computers? The best financial decision you'll ever make.</p>\n<p>Any question, please feel free to ask. I am available 7 days a week.&nbsp; <br></p>",

We meet informally over dinner in VC / startup boardroom in London, hear some very short talks from sector experts on opportunists and brainstorm ways of potentially building an AI based business around them. If the potential of AI gets you excited and you fit in to any of the categories above come and say hi! We started this group because the conference scene and founder meetup groups are an incredibly inefficient way of finding like minded people, we'd rather just say what we're looking to do and see who else has the same drive to make it happen.</p>",

In this regular, London-based evening Meetup you\u2019ll see talks by everyone from developers, theorists and technology specialists that dive through how to apply machine learning, particularly deep learning, algorithms to real-world use cases. In particular, we will be examining various deep learning toolkits and applying them to analyze actual data sets. Laptops will be required for the practical workshops, but this will be announced before the Meetup. The emphasis here is on actually applying AI and ML, from the coal face.</p>",

Technology domains include healthcare, biotech, medicine, transportation, finance, nanotechnology, robotics, neuroscience, information sciences and &nbsp;quantum computing. We will explore the impact that A.I. is having in each of these technology areas, where we are now, what we can expect over the coming years, as well as the likely impact such develoments will bring to businesses and to society as a whole. Speakers from industry and academia are invited to share their experience in developing and implementing A.I. and deep learning solutions in the real world. <br></p>",

We might still be at a very early stage, new bots are florishing every day and they are rapidly getting more and more accurate and relevant. Yet brands, corporates, e-retailers, customer services, media are all still wondering how to approach it. It seems everyone wants to experiment but everyone wonders which solution to go for.

We'll be holding the first few events at our studios in Shoreditch, but if we need more space, we'll find somewhere larger. We'll be having some guest speakers at events, some time to show and tell your new stuff, and also well-made plans to head to the pub afterwards. Get involved!</p>",

As a participatory political system, democracy is due to be redesigned and rebuild, so it works for everybody. &lt;br&gt;</p>\n<p><b>Our mission: </b>Code for Democracy wants to positively influence the process of decision making by encouraging and facilitating broader participation in the democratic process.</p>\n<p><b>How we do it: </b>Code for Democracy <b>organizes</b> meetups/workshops that'll become a catalyst for political and digital action. Code for Democracy <b>ships</b> software tools that support the four key elements of a solid democratic system. Code for Democracy <b>educates</b> the public to help be/stay open, inclusive and value equality. We hope to foster an understanding of&nbsp;the importance of politics and spark participation in the decision-making processes that affect all of us.</p>\n<p>Join us for our first meetup in Jan., respectively Feb. 2017 and help define the biggest problems and key (software) solutions and goals we should meet first.</p>\n<p>-----</p>\n<p>Code for Democracy is <b>not a political party</b>. We <b>cross borders </b>and work with software designers and engineers across the globe to be truly diverse. We have a human-centric (software) design process.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Trading Circle Research <br></p>\n<p>Having been in trading for more than seven years, I realize just how hard it can be to find systems and indicators that work. I understand how expensive the research required to keep up with the ever-changing market can be. I also know how difficult it is to learn programming, and how costly using programmers to test your ideas can be. That being said, we want to build a rich environment for research; so members can find the most successful programming methodologies, and produce original ideas. Unlike the one-trick-wonders who claim to have all of the answers, and charge enormous amount of money for people to use faulty systems year after year with an insufficient portfolio of results, we separate ourselves from the competition with a proven track record of success.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>For All Ages and Skill Levels</p>\n<p>We accommodate all skill levels, regardless of prior experience with programming. We merely ask that you contribute by doing research,and/or providing us with your honest opinion. So instead of spending thousands of pounds a year on empty promises, our aim is to create a community where people can come together, and be provided with material to do research and share new ideas. As it stands now, only Quants are able to use the algorithms they make. We would like to give everyone access; regardless of educational level.</p>\n<p>Learning Materials</p>\n<p>Members will have access to a huge library of trading material: Books, videos, programming scripts, and the latest software. Material will be updated every month making sure members have access to the most up-todate information.</p>\n<br>\n<p>Cutting out programming cost and time</p>\n<p>Enjoy the benefits of your programming abilities, which will give you a great edge as a trader. Programming allows you to try out new ideas and be spontaneously creative in the trading world. In order to allow our members to do research, and produce creative results, we will have full-time dedicated programmers. Our professionally-trained programmers will produce the work for all of our clients.</p>\n<br>\n<p>Working with Experts</p>\n<p>We will also have experts whom members can consult, and who will be producing the latest scripts. Whether it\u2019s Quant algorithms, Automated trading algorithms, or Artificial Intelligence (AKA AI), ie. (Deep learning); we will have the staff and tools necessary to produce results</p>\n<br>\n<p>Member only Trading Platform</p>\n<p>We will also have a \u201cmembers only\u201d trading platform, that will give us unlimited capabilities to produce our members\u2019 ideas of their wildest imaginations.</p>\n<p>The cost of the subscription will be \u00a350 a month. This will give you access to a large collection of Trading materials and coding services.</p>\n<p><br></p>",

        "description": "<p>\u2018The Human Decision System \u2013 our route to ADI\u2019</p> \n<p>Automated Decision Intelligence Meeting in Central London, 16.00 Thursday 18th May.</p> \n<p>ADI \u2013 Automated Decision Intelligence, is the umbrella concept embracing both real and artificial intelligence. ADI builds on the existence of biological decision systems that, driven by evolution, convert data from \u2018chance\u2019 into \u2018probability\u2019 for predictions. The advent of the digital computer has scaled this evolutionary process in both speed and capacity, and computerised systems that mimic biological decision systems are now taking the lead. Thus the hype about Big Data, machine learning, deep learning and Ai in general \u2013 but this is a subject we all need to understand. Biological decision systems determine all forms of behaviour \u2013 from E.coli bacteria at the bottom of the evolutionary scale, to humans at the top. The human decision system is the most advanced of the biological decision systems.</p> \n<p>We invite you to attend this introduction to biological decision systems. You will meet Finn Gilling, the author of the groundbreaking book \u2018The Human Decision System\u2019, learn about the origins, structure and functions of biological decision systems and about the human decision system in detail. This knowledge will provide you with an essential grounding in Automated Decision Intelligence and enable you to construct efficient and useful algorithms for life, business and science.</p> \n<p>This workshop is part of a full day programme \u2013 for more details and to book your place go to <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/automated-decision-intelligence-adi-workshops-tickets-34274872065\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.eventbrite.com/e/automated-decision-intelligence-adi-workshops-tickets-34274872065</a></p> \n<p>There is a small charge to cover refreshments and a donation to Scope, the charity that supports disabled people in life and business</p>",

The main event will take place in Newspeak House in London. Are you not able to come to London? No worries! You can join us online during one of the online Democracy Cafe sessions that will take place during the day. You can sign up here to take part in the online Democracy Cafe sessions. You will receive an invitation by e-mail for a Zoom meeting just before the session you registered for starts. We also invite and encourage you to organise local events on the 4th of February, across Europe, in conjunction with the London event. If you have a physical place where people can meet up and you are willing to organise a local event, please drop us an email at democracycafe@gmail.com. The programme:&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br>(Please note that all times are in GMT): <br>09:45-10:00 Room open in Newspeak house <br>10:00-10:30 Introduction, Live streamed on Zoom <br>10:30-11:30 Meet each other and Presentation of topics <br>11:30-13:30 First Democracy Cafe Round - Practising Democracy and Use Cases <br>13:30-14:30 Lunch break at Newspeak house <br>14:30-15:00 Feedback session <br>15:00-18:00 Second Democracy Cafe Round - Events and Use Cases <br>18:00-19:30 Wrap up and feedback <br>19:30 Wrap up and drinks at Newspeak house</p>\n<p>About the Democracy Cafes: <br>The purpose of Democracy Cafes is to make genuine transnational politics possible, by providing an online space in which political activists from across Europe can meet and discuss pressing political issues in an informal \u201cCafe\u201d setting. Think of it as the digital equivalent of Habermas\u2019 coffeehouse. Democracy Cafes are meant for idea generation, not consolidation, which means that everyone\u2019s opinion is listened to and respected. The Democracy Cafes are online meetings with audio and video. During these meetings, the main facilitator introduces the question on the table and splits the main group into small groups of people that can discuss the question for a designated period of time. After the discussions of small group end, everyone returns to the main room and summaries are given of the outcomes of the discussions.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Mapping for Social and Political Change brings together experts and enthusiasts from the wonderful world of maps and all kinds of data visualisation. We will be showcasing a wide range of mapping projects that seek to bring about some kind of positive impact on society. Our first event, which was so popular that we were inspired to create this series, ranged from maps that improve response to humanitarian disasters, to land ownership maps to protect rainforest rights, to local projects that put underrepresented communities at the forefront of planning and funding decisions for their local area, and maps that show air and noise pollution. </p> \n<p>This Meetup series aims to be eclectic and inclusive. We'll be looking at mapping data and good data visualisations (so it won't just be about geographical maps), maps that are playful and participatory, collective mapping projects and more. We are not limited to one specific locality. Each event will have around 4 key speakers and time for discussion, skillsharing and networking. We're always on the lookout for new projects so if you have an idea, or would like to present, please just get in touch!</p>",

        "description": "<p>The main tool we will use for developing our effective thinking is - 'Graphical Thinking' - which is a low-text, high-content, anti-rhetorical, holistic, inclusive and accessible Thinking Tool for: Learning, Thinking, Understanding, Explaining, Discussing, Collaborating, Communicating, and Consciously Reviewing and Updating your existing (often pre-conscious and rigid) Models and Beliefs.</p>\n<p>It is suitable for anyone older than 7yrs - particularly Pupils, Parents, Students, Teachers, Apprentices, Manual Workers, Office Workers, Stakeholder Managers, Product Owners, Scrum Masters, Investors, Policy Think Tanks, Dyslexics, Academics, Journalists, Politicians, &amp; Voters.</p>\n<p>Have a look at the slide show under the PHOTOS TAB, for an introduction to this approach. NB use the arrows (not the 'Play slideshow') so you can see the explanatory captions. Much better experienced on a computer screen than a smart phone. &lt;br&gt;</p>\n<p>Graphical Thinking encourages a focus on : &lt;br&gt;Things and Concepts - their properties &amp; values, capabilities, behaviors, categories, life cycles, contexts, &lt;br&gt;and &lt;br&gt;The Relationships between those Things and Concepts.</p>\n<p>This style of thinking is an essential preparation for, and an introduction to, Systems Thinking - thinking about the behaviors of complicated, complex, and chaotic systems (fast becoming a required skill and anyway - its a very useful skill to have). &lt;br&gt;</p>\n<p>For those who like a technical justification - it is based on: Entity Relationship Diagramming - for modelling and reviewing your perception of the structure of the situation, (extended to include categories (type and quality), domains, behaviour repertoires, life cycles of possibility and probability, network types and attributes, emergent properties, behaviours and archetypal patterns),</p>\n<p>XML triplets for semantic precision,</p>\n<p>Venn diagramming to; &lt;br&gt;encourage subtle distinctions - and appropriate categorization, to resist over-generalized - one = some = all stereotyping.</p>\n<p>It encourage and authorizes curiosity and openness.</p>\n<p>It embraces and acknowledges multiple viewpoints.</p>\n<p>It facilitates precise holistic discussion.</p>\n<p>It acknowledges our cognitive biases and works with the native strengths and weaknesses of human thinking.</p>\n<p>It uses: Many-to-Many resolution tables to clarify the complicated, and hard copy holistic-diagram memory tools to overcome the focus-distorting limitations of our (only five things at any one time) working memory.</p>\n<p>Then you can start to think about the Dynamics of the System: &lt;br&gt;lean and sloppy feedback loops &amp; oscillations, protected areas, &lt;br&gt;processes, flows and stores, black boxes, goal setting and goal-chasing behaviours, &lt;br&gt;rules and regulations, forces of attraction and repulsion, incentives and disincentives, limits to growth, tragedies of the commons, etc.</p>\n<p>Then you can 'Wind the handle' to: explore, model, assess and predict the emergent behaviour patterns and assess the systems viability (very important).</p>\n<p>Because this is all based on native cognitive abilities which we all have as our birthright - every aspect of this approach can be experienced as a simple fun curious creative (eureka buzz) game, with no need for specialist vocabulary or prior expertise in any of these concepts.</p>\n<p>Everyone can do this. We just need to practice. &lt;br&gt;</p>",
