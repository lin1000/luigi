GRAKN.AI is a hyper-relational database that allows you to perform knowledge engineering to manage this complexity. Effectively, Grakn provides a Knowledge Base (aka. Knowledge Graph) as the core foundation of intelligent systems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Grakn provides an intelligent query language, Graql: Grakn’s reasoning (through OLTP) and analytics (through OLAP) query language, which is a much higher-level abstraction over traditional query languages. This allows intelligent systems to benefit from an intuitive language the provides&nbsp;an expressive schema for knowledge modelling, reasoning transactions for real-time inference, distributed algorithms for large-scale analytics, and optimisation of query execution. Grakn also provides the logical integrity of SQL, the scale of relationships of Graph databases, and the horizontal scalability of NoSQL. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In this community, we discuss the underlying technology and applications of the Grakn hyper-relational database. We will also discuss the techniques of a new software engineering principle, Knowledge-Driven Development, that Grakn now enables.

<p><b>B.U.I.L.D</b>&nbsp;(Businesses United​ ​for Innovation, Learning and Development)&nbsp;is set up to offer more opportunities for people with an entrepreneurial mindset to learn from each other and build successful businesses. Together.</p>
<p>Why join&nbsp;<b>B.U.I.L.D</b>?</p>
<p>If you are looking to participate in events like workshops, trainings, lectures, seminars, hackathons aiming to transform you and your business for success and you consider yourself a business B.U.I.L.D:er, it would be foolish of you not to join this group.</p>
<p><b>A business B.U.I.L.D:er is:</b></p>
<p>·&nbsp; anyone who wants to build a successful business;</p>
<p>·&nbsp; somebody who has an entrepreneurial mindset = often drawn to opportunities, innovation, new value creation and willing to take risks</p>
<p>·&nbsp; an employee curious about starting a business or wanting to apply entrepreneurial thinking at his/her workplace.</p>
<p>·&nbsp; a smart manager or business owner looking for innovation ideas,</p>
<p>·&nbsp; an edgy consultant, freelancer or solopreneur</p>
<p>·&nbsp; a student or researcher with an entrepreneurship interest</p>
<p>Do you see value and opportunities in networking and want business dreams to come true in mutually beneficial ways? Invest in yourself and a more entrepreneurial world today and come along!</p>
<p><b>What is a B.U.I.L.D event?</b></p>
<p>B.U.I.L.D&nbsp;events can be about sales, marketing, branding, customer engagement, self development, finance, law, growth hacking and any other topic which in one way or another can help businesses become more awesome.</p>
<p><b>Become an event organizer</b></p>
<p>•&nbsp;You can attend events and benefit from networking with likeminded. However,&nbsp;<b>your benefits can be massive if you organize these events yourself</b>. Events and Meetup groups are a great way to get:</p>
<p>•&nbsp;connections</p>
<p>•&nbsp;promote your services and expertise</p>
<p>•&nbsp;goodwill&nbsp;</p>
<p>•&nbsp;test ideas</p>
<p>•&nbsp;feedback</p>
<p>•&nbsp;referrals&nbsp;</p>
<p>•&nbsp;introductions</p>
<p>Being part of a bigger organization and group opens more doors than going about it alone. B.U.I.L.D exists in 11 cities in Europe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Running a successful Meetup-group also requires, much like a business, grit and a lot of time, dedication and effort. What if you could go in lean and test your session by organizing only one event?</p>
<p>We at B.U.I.L.D give you a chance to organize just one event (or more in the future) under the B.U.I.L.D. brand with its existing members instead of starting your own Meetup group from scratch.</p>
<p><b>How to apply</b></p>
<p>If you would like to promote your service by sharing your knowledge and expertise with other professionals and entrepreneurs with a workshop or get-together; apply to get your event published and promoted by contacting EntAnon's Community Manager Jenny via e-mail on jenny.bjorklof@entanon.com. You get support on how to organize great B.U.I.L.D events by experienced business event organizers.</p>
<p>Please note: Free events = free support, paid events = agreed profit share on a case to case basis.</p>
<p><b>The history of B.U.I.L.D</b></p>
<p>B.U.I.L.D is a brand by EntAnon (short for Entrepreneurs Anonymous). In 2015 more than 30 thought provoking events were organized by EntAnon and B.U.I.L.D (that is at least one event every second week) engaging thousands of members. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The name Entrepreneurs Anonymous could stand for being addicted to Entrepreneurship and having an urgent need to get group support for it. But actually Entrepreneurs Anonymous is more about providing a safe place with like-minded people where entrepreneurship can be explored. Here Entrepreneurs-to-be and undercover entrepreneurs from corporates have been spotted too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Entrepreneurs Anonymous events started in Dublin, Ireland in 2011 as accountability group by former students of an entrepreneurship course. The interest for the group grew and now social events with guest speakers are organized every last Tuesday of the month. With a membership increase by 10% each month it was quickly realized last Tuesday-events were simply just not enough for the Anonymous Entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>B.U.I.L.D&nbsp;was set up to offer more opportunities for Entrepreneurs to learn from each other. So far&nbsp;B.U.I.L.D&nbsp;events like the Gigonomy Panel discussion, Speed Business Networking and the Free Business Clinic have been organized. B.U.I.L.D also organizes former DDM events. These are events for people especially interested in Data Driven Marketing.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>More about B.U.I.L.D and DDM Alliance</b></p>
<p>EntAnon's brand&nbsp;​​B.U.I.L.D partnered&nbsp;​ with the former Data Driven Marketing Alliance (DDM). Future ​DDM&nbsp;​meetups and other events in Copenhagen, Berlin, Belgium, Dublin,&nbsp;Dusseldorf, Helsinki, London, Manchester, Netherlands, Paris,&nbsp;Stockholm, ​soon ​Milano​ and other parts of Europe will be organized together with B.U.I.L.D. DDM representatives​ can&nbsp;​set up online events​ ​(webinars and conferences) and&nbsp;use the B.U.I.L.D. groups around Europe ​as ​​a channel.&nbsp;If another B.U​.​I​.​L​.​D or EntAnon​ ​event is set on the same date the organizers agree​ ​on the next best date for the&nbsp;DDM&nbsp;Alliance event to take​ ​place.</p>","EntAnon",193727111

<p><b><span>Does TensorFlow have the potential to become the engine behind most successful consumer and industrial products of the next 10-20 years?&nbsp;</span><br></b></p>
<p>Absolutely!&nbsp;<b>A much better question is&nbsp;how, and in what new ways, can we:</b></p>
<p>a) train more computers to teach themselves by sifting through massive amounts of data coming out of all sorts of places</p>
<p>b) make these computers available through an API to provide a high-quality answer to anyone who is in need.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><br></b></p>
<p><b>Why?&nbsp;</b>Because everyone in need deserves the right answer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So.... why don't we standardize &amp; democratize the field with and around TensorFlow, and help change the world!?</p>
<p><b>What.</b>&nbsp;We are a local micro community of those interested in advancing their knowledge of TensorFlow, its use cases and applications.</p>
<p><b>How.&nbsp;</b>Join our group for a regular dose of human interaction, conversations, smiles, food and drinks on all things TensorFlow:</p>

<p>The first meetup is a good introduction for anyone new to python, and introduces Anaconda and is a good place to start. If you have worked your way through this tutorial you will find the meetups easier to get to grips with.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second meetup is an an excellent example of our meetups, where a topic or set of skills is introduced before demonstrating how they can be applied in python. For example, in this meetup Zak introduced what clustering is, why it is useful and gave some example code.&nbsp;</p>

She played an instrumental lead in the design and development of Oracle’s industry leading enterprise drives including the T10000C and T10000D as well as in the introduction of the first Barium Ferrite magnetic tape for high capacity storage. She served as the Technology Team Lead for the most recent Information Storage Industry Consortium ‘s (INSIC) 2015-2025 tape storage roadmap. With a PhD in physical chemistry from the University of Colorado-Boulder, April began her career in the hard disk drive industry as a process engineer designing and manufacturing recording heads. Through an acquisition, April entered the world of magnetic tape storage. Finding that recording heads were often blamed for drive problems, she switched to the other popular scapegoat for issues, the tape cartridge and media development. As her career progressed and acquisitions occurred (StorageTek to Sun Microsystems to Oracle), she gained responsibilities for the magnetic recording group and then the entire tape drive development organization.

19016212,"Turning to Complexity","Turning-to-Complexity-Beta","https://www.meetup.com/Turning-to-Complexity-Beta/",4.79,1444563076000,"<p>Welcome to the complexity meetup. This is a place for all people interested in complexity issues to meet and share insights about complexity, systems thinking and holistic approaches to complex challenges. The human brain, ecosystems, economies and social networks are all great examples of complex systems as they have many parts interconnected with each other without central control or design and exhibit subtle and unpredictable behavior.</p>
<p>We all experience a complex, interconnected&nbsp; and holistic world so everyone interested is very welcome to join. <br></p>
<p>Complexity based thinking challenges many assumptions about the world, for example:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; A system can be fully understood</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; The components of a system can be analyzed, and by adding together all the components we understand the behavior of the whole</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; The behavior of a system can be predicted</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; The outputs of a system will be proportional to the inputs</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; The system can be understood isolated from the environment, ignoring the interconnections with other systems.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; Events have a single cause that can be isolated.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; Unintended consequences are the rule rather than the exception. Expect unintended consequences to any attempts to make improvements, and be prepared to make changes to take account of the unintended consequences,.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; Complex systems have paradoxical behavior. The definition of a complex system is unclear. They evolve and stay the same, some behavior is predictable e.g. adaptation to the environment and other behaviour is unpredictable <br></p>
<p>9. The examples above are over-simplifications and will not apply in all cases, complexity itself is complex so these are just some viewpoints. <br></p>
<p>By studying complex systems we hope to become more holistic and interconnected in our thinking about the world. This alternative viewpoint may contribute to being able to make improvements in complex ecological, social and economic issues or to grow organizations in challenging environments. </p>
<p>I hope that by popularizing insights from complexity research, this shared understanding will help people trying to make big improvements in the world to become more effective.</p>
<p> Another goal is that by aligning your thinking and beliefs with the behavior of complex systems, you will become more aligned with how complex systems operate e.g. your own behavior, social groups, organizations, ecosystems. Hopefully then you will be less surprised by what happens, and less emotionally attached to outcomes that cannot be controlled, and better able to flourish amid uncertainty and change.</p>

<p>Our aim is to bring together vendors, suppliers, enthusiasts and IT professionals, and anyone who's just curious concerning Linux and open source software, its strengths, its capacity and its mysteries.</p>
<p>We make every effort to be an inclusive group. Please be sure to familiarise yourself with <a href=""https://linuxinginlondon.wordpress.com/code-of-conduct-2017/"">our code of conduct. </a></p>
<p>Everyday we use Linux and open source software without even knowing it. It powers Google, Facebook, Docker and most of the Internet infrastructure. Without Linux and open source the world would not be as connected as it is, or look as it does.</p>
<p>In this modern age the development of open source software and Linux is striking. It is changing every week, there are new products coming out, almost at the speed of light. We feel there needs to be a tangible and friendly space to discuss those developments and learn from each other, that isn’t the pub or dominated by men.<br></p>
<p>Our objectives:</p>
<p>• to provide a safe and friendly environment where people can come together, talk and be informed about free and open source software.</p>
<p>• to hold regular presentations from open source specialists on everything from the Linux kernel, the command line to Linux in the Cloud, and much more.</p>
<p>• encourage everyone to talk about and to use free and open source software.&nbsp; We are Linux distribution agnostic, we like BSD and all derivatives too!</p>
<p><b>All of our events are free to participants.</b></p>
<p>We are committed to a non-profit ethos and make a real effort to address the gender imbalance in technology. Women get ticketing priority at all Linuxing In London events.<br></p>
<p>We meet at London's premier technology venue, Skills Matter, every month.<br></p>

<p>SoGive is building the only comprehensive database of charity impact, taking data from the public domain and amalgamating it. This will help donors to take a data-driven approach to making charitable donation decisions.</p> 
<p>We hold events on the first and third Saturday of the month where people get together and gather/analyse charity data together.</p> 
<p>WHAT HAPPENS AT THE EVENT?<br>The session will start with a run-through of the charity analysis approach used by SoGive, given by Sanjay. We will then go ahead and analyse several charities. WHY WOULD I WANT TO ATTEND?<br>This will be a great opportunity for people who want any of the following:<br>*** to get to know more about the assessment of charity impact<br>*** to know more about what's happening in the charity sector<br>*** to contribute to an exciting project that may influence a huge number of people with their charitable giving<br>*** anyone who is planning to move into the charity sector/apply for a job there would find this would gain a real edge from this training</p> 
<p>SOME PRACTICALITIES<br>- Please bring a laptop (or other device that you can work from)<br>- Arriving late or leaving early are absolutely fine (but if you can arrive on time that would be good if it's your first time, since there will be an intro at the start)<br>- SoGive will cover the costs of teas or coffees bought at the venue (relevant for events held in a cafe)</p> 
<p>If you need to get in touch (e.g. for help with finding the venue) you can call me on 07962 817097</p> 
<p>MORE QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE<br>-- What skills do I need?<br>Ability to read, understand, and interpret information about charities. No need to be able to code, although familiarity with spreadsheets is useful</p> 
<p>-- Will I do very in depth charity analysis?<br>SoGive aims to be broad and cover lots of charities, rather than go into things in depth.</p> 
<p>-- Do I have to attend in person?<br>This is easiest to do if you're London-based and can come to the venue, although we have accommodated people participating remotely as well. Best to say something in advance if you want to do this.</p>","Sanjay",6146261

<p><b>How?</b> <br></p>
<p> Each coder, using a laptop, is paired with another coder. They get a chance to showcase their code to each other, discuss ways of working with code, and maybe even write a bit of code. After 15 minutes, the coders rotate and are paired with a new coder. <br></p>
<p>This gives coders an efficient way to see which coders they want to collaborate with further in a hackathon or otherwise. Every Snack and Hack revolves around a specific technology.</p>","Yaz",200127499

<p> <br></p>
<p>There is a strong professional CRM community in London with no real recurring event to give everyone the opportunity to meet. This group aims to serve the needs of all CRM professionals in particular by providing a place to meet face-to-face, exchange some of the latest ideas and chat it all our over a few drinks/snacks with new friends.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Unlike the large corporate events that are run purely for the benefit of that particular CRM system (such as the Salesforce World Tour), this event aims to be unbiased and instead welcomes all different types of systems, topics, speakers and point of views surrounding CRM. We believe this approach will create a truly open and helpful forum that everyone should be able to take something away from.</p>

<p>Many times I don't know what to exactly reply to feature requests, process implementations, or questions about why things are done in a specific way. Most of the time the questions make a lot of sense, there is not just a way to make things in DevOps, a lot is about your taste, feeling, and ideas about how automation should be written and tools should be implemented. There are an infinite number of ways of doing things, this community is a great place to meet new people, share, discuss and learn about different ways of doing Enterprise DevOps.</p>

<p>MINING: Thinking of buying&nbsp;mining rigs? Or perhaps buying into online mining contracts? Join this Meetup before spending any money.</p>
<p>If you are reading / thinking of joining this meetup, you have, at some point, thought about start mining a cryptocurrency or at least heard of it and curios what is all the heap about.</p>
<p>Mining is not dead, in fact is very much alive despite what everyone say.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Popular Q&amp;A&nbsp; <br>. Where should you start? At this meetup&nbsp; <br>. Will it work? (Mining..) YES&nbsp; <br>. Is it (still) profitable? Yeees!&nbsp; <br>. Do I need a lot of money? At least £3000 to make it worthwhile&nbsp; <br>. Is the investment secure? Is one of the most secure investments you'll ever make&nbsp; <br>. What returns should I expect? It vary but it could be well over 100% per year, ~30% worst case scenario. Yes, there is a huge difference between the two; welcome to the cryptocurrency world! Think about how much time / effort it takes to get even 1% from any investment (think trading, banking, not to mention that most businesses have an end of year net profits of 7% to 15%) unless you deal with drugs, there isn't anything else out there this consistent, safe &amp; profitable.&nbsp; <br>. Is it legal? Yes, 100%. The UK (HMRC) treat any cryptocurrency as any other currency since 2014&nbsp; <br>. Are profits from mining taxable? Yes, if you declare them. Have you ever traded online? Did you report gains/profits/losses to the HMRC? Mining follow the same concept. As a company is obviously more profitable to declare rent, capital expenses, running costs and gains.&nbsp; <br>. What do I need to do to maintain the rigs? Absolutely nothing, or at least that's the goal. Like a car, it need a MOT once on a while (dust spray the graphic cards radiators/fans) and it can be done with a £2 compressed air canister you can find at any computer / DIY store. Checking your profits and making sure is all going as it should, once on a day, is not a bad idea either. And if you have lots of mining rigs, you will already have some idea of what it takes to maintain a server room or will get a crash course on it :)</p>
<p>If you are serious about mining, this meetup is where your worries will rest.</p>
<p>With dozens of happy customers and 100's of mining rigs installed all over the UK, you are in good hands; in fact there are very few good hands in UK that does this professionally.</p>
<p>Have been building mining rigs for more than a year and continue to do it as my main and only job through own company. <br>Months of research and thousands of pounds went into it (including: server grade graphic card like the Firepro S1950, Intel 6900K, 12 cores Intel Xeon processor, R9 Nano &amp; GTX 1080 Ti mining rigs etc)&nbsp; <br>Own &amp; successfully run a ""small"" mining farm in Central London.</p>
<p>There will be no hard selling, the Meetup will be very relaxed and anyone is welcome to talk to each other.</p>
<p>Is not late to start, is never too late! In fact this is just the infancy of cryptocurrencies and the perfect time to start!</p>
<p>Come and join me, and get all of your question answered (or at least most of them!)</p>
<p>PS: do not expect to be taught how to build a mining rig or fix one (if you are in either situation it means you haven't done your homework properly.. no one can do that for you)</p>
<p>Who should join this meetup:&nbsp; <br>- people with at least £3000 to invest | any less and it won't be worthwhile.&nbsp; <br>- those £3000+ must not be your only savings | mining is for the long term; investing into equipments with your last resources is never a good idea.&nbsp; <br>- investors or company's owners with taxable earnings / profits on financial year's end | companies or individual in the higher tax brackets have huge advantages when buying / running a mining farm.&nbsp; <br>- people with a good / excellent credit rating | most people don't even blink when they have to buy a £20K car.. how about opening a loan to invest into crypto mining computers? The best financial decision you'll ever make.</p>
<p>Any question, please feel free to ask. I am available 7 days a week.&nbsp; <br></p>","Paolo Schiavon",8686961

<p><span>Convergence is the culmination of four years’ work as a blockchain venture fund and builder having engaged with other 1,200 from around the world.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>During that time it has become clear to our team at Outlier Ventures, that blockchain is most impactful and investible at the intersections of two or more emerging technologies and applied to clear verticals like Industry 4.0 or Smart Cities and Mobility.</span></p>
<p><span>We first saw this begin to be realised where blockchains begun to be applied to and combined with the Internet of Things (IoT) and more recently artificial intelligence (AI).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As we started investigating, convergence opportunities were increasingly everywhere from securing 3D printing distribution networks to verifiable drone delivery networks and chatbots using blockchains to make payments on behalf of their users.</span></p>
<p><span><b>Our thesis is that blockchain technologies, including distributed ledgers &amp; smart contracts, are the infrastructure that allows all other macro-trends to converge through a common operating system and shared standards. They represent the next phase of The Web, Web 3.0 or ‘The Trust Web’, and will to transform how technologies interact with one another and the World around them.&nbsp;</b></span></p>
<p><span><b>Even more interestingly they will begin to accelerate one another leading to a cambrian explosion of innovation it will be difficult for any one business to keep pace with on their own.</b></span></p>
<p><span>It is this challenge that led us to create the Convergence VC community to enable people to break out of their silos and begin to openly collaborate across technologies and sectors and we invite you to join our global conversation.</span></p>
<p><span>As technologies combine and converge in unexpected and profound ways, interdisciplinary thinking is more important than ever. We hope these events will contribute to and enable important cross-disciplinary discussions and start-ups.</span></p>

<p>Having been in trading for more than seven years, I realize just how hard it can be to find systems and indicators that work. I understand how expensive the research required to keep up with the ever-changing market can be. I also know how difficult it is to learn programming, and how costly using programmers to test your ideas can be. That being said, we want to build a rich environment for research; so members can find the most successful programming methodologies, and produce original ideas. Unlike the one-trick-wonders who claim to have all of the answers, and charge enormous amount of money for people to use faulty systems year after year with an insufficient portfolio of results, we separate ourselves from the competition with a proven track record of success.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>For All Ages and Skill Levels</p>
<p>We accommodate all skill levels, regardless of prior experience with programming. We merely ask that you contribute by doing research,and/or providing us with your honest opinion. So instead of spending thousands of pounds a year on empty promises, our aim is to create a community where people can come together, and be provided with material to do research and share new ideas. As it stands now, only Quants are able to use the algorithms they make. We would like to give everyone access; regardless of educational level.</p>
<p>Learning Materials</p>
<p>Members will have access to a huge library of trading material: Books, videos, programming scripts, and the latest software. Material will be updated every month making sure members have access to the most up-todate information.</p>
<br>
<p>Cutting out programming cost and time</p>
<p>Enjoy the benefits of your programming abilities, which will give you a great edge as a trader. Programming allows you to try out new ideas and be spontaneously creative in the trading world. In order to allow our members to do research, and produce creative results, we will have full-time dedicated programmers. Our professionally-trained programmers will produce the work for all of our clients.</p>
<br>
<p>Working with Experts</p>
<p>We will also have experts whom members can consult, and who will be producing the latest scripts. Whether it’s Quant algorithms, Automated trading algorithms, or Artificial Intelligence (AKA AI), ie. (Deep learning); we will have the staff and tools necessary to produce results</p>
<br>
<p>Member only Trading Platform</p>
<p>We will also have a “members only” trading platform, that will give us unlimited capabilities to produce our members’ ideas of their wildest imaginations.</p>
<p>The cost of the subscription will be £50 a month. This will give you access to a large collection of Trading materials and coding services.</p>

<p>Automated Decision Intelligence Meeting in Central London, 16.00 Thursday 18th May.</p> 
<p>ADI – Automated Decision Intelligence, is the umbrella concept embracing both real and artificial intelligence. ADI builds on the existence of biological decision systems that, driven by evolution, convert data from ‘chance’ into ‘probability’ for predictions. The advent of the digital computer has scaled this evolutionary process in both speed and capacity, and computerised systems that mimic biological decision systems are now taking the lead. Thus the hype about Big Data, machine learning, deep learning and Ai in general – but this is a subject we all need to understand. Biological decision systems determine all forms of behaviour – from E.coli bacteria at the bottom of the evolutionary scale, to humans at the top. The human decision system is the most advanced of the biological decision systems.</p> 
<p>We invite you to attend this introduction to biological decision systems. You will meet Finn Gilling, the author of the groundbreaking book ‘The Human Decision System’, learn about the origins, structure and functions of biological decision systems and about the human decision system in detail. This knowledge will provide you with an essential grounding in Automated Decision Intelligence and enable you to construct efficient and useful algorithms for life, business and science.</p> 
<p>This workshop is part of a full day programme – for more details and to book your place go to <a href=""https://www.eventbrite.com/e/automated-decision-intelligence-adi-workshops-tickets-34274872065"" class=""linkified"">https://www.eventbrite.com/e/automated-decision-intelligence-adi-workshops-tickets-34274872065</a></p>

You can join us online during one of the online Democracy Cafe sessions that will take place during the day. You can sign up here to take part in the online Democracy Cafe sessions. You will receive an invitation by e-mail for a Zoom meeting just before the session you registered for starts. We also invite and encourage you to organise local events on the 4th of February, across Europe, in conjunction with the London event. If you have a physical place where people can meet up and you are willing to organise a local event, please drop us an email at democracycafe@gmail.com. The programme:&nbsp;</p>

<p>About the Democracy Cafes: <br>The purpose of Democracy Cafes is to make genuine transnational politics possible, by providing an online space in which political activists from across Europe can meet and discuss pressing political issues in an informal “Cafe” setting. Think of it as the digital equivalent of Habermas’ coffeehouse. Democracy Cafes are meant for idea generation, not consolidation, which means that everyone’s opinion is listened to and respected. The Democracy Cafes are online meetings with audio and video. During these meetings, the main facilitator introduces the question on the table and splits the main group into small groups of people that can discuss the question for a designated period of time. After the discussions of small group end, everyone returns to the main room and summaries are given of the outcomes of the discussions.</p>","David Bovill",8761276

Our first event, which was so popular that we were inspired to create this series, ranged from maps that improve response to humanitarian disasters, to land ownership maps to protect rainforest rights, to local projects that put underrepresented communities at the forefront of planning and funding decisions for their local area, and maps that show air and noise pollution. </p> 
<p>This Meetup series aims to be eclectic and inclusive. We'll be looking at mapping data and good data visualisations (so it won't just be about geographical maps), maps that are playful and participatory, collective mapping projects and more.

28332258,"Effective Thinking Understanding Discussing Explaining.","Effective-Thinking","https://www.meetup.com/Effective-Thinking/",0,1525076702000,"<p>The main tool we will use for developing our effective thinking is - 'Graphical Thinking' - which is a low-text, high-content, anti-rhetorical, holistic, inclusive and accessible Thinking Tool for: Learning, Thinking, Understanding, Explaining, Discussing, Collaborating, Communicating, and Consciously Reviewing and Updating your existing (often pre-conscious and rigid) Models and Beliefs.</p>
<p>It is suitable for anyone older than 7yrs - particularly Pupils, Parents, Students, Teachers, Apprentices, Manual Workers, Office Workers, Stakeholder Managers, Product Owners, Scrum Masters, Investors, Policy Think Tanks, Dyslexics, Academics, Journalists, Politicians, &amp; Voters.</p>
<p>Have a look at the slide show under the PHOTOS TAB, for an introduction to this approach. NB use the arrows (not the 'Play slideshow') so you can see the explanatory captions. Much better experienced on a computer screen than a smart phone. &lt;br&gt;</p>
<p>Graphical Thinking encourages a focus on : &lt;br&gt;Things and Concepts - their properties &amp; values, capabilities, behaviors, categories, life cycles, contexts, &lt;br&gt;and &lt;br&gt;The Relationships between those Things and Concepts.</p>
<p>This style of thinking is an essential preparation for, and an introduction to, Systems Thinking - thinking about the behaviors of complicated, complex, and chaotic systems (fast becoming a required skill and anyway - its a very useful skill to have). &lt;br&gt;</p>
<p>For those who like a technical justification - it is based on: Entity Relationship Diagramming - for modelling and reviewing your perception of the structure of the situation, (extended to include categories (type and quality), domains, behaviour repertoires, life cycles of possibility and probability, network types and attributes, emergent properties, behaviours and archetypal patterns),</p>
<p>XML triplets for semantic precision,</p>
<p>Venn diagramming to; &lt;br&gt;encourage subtle distinctions - and appropriate categorization, to resist over-generalized - one = some = all stereotyping.</p>
<p>It encourage and authorizes curiosity and openness.</p>
<p>It embraces and acknowledges multiple viewpoints.</p>
<p>It facilitates precise holistic discussion.</p>
<p>It acknowledges our cognitive biases and works with the native strengths and weaknesses of human thinking.</p>
<p>It uses: Many-to-Many resolution tables to clarify the complicated, and hard copy holistic-diagram memory tools to overcome the focus-distorting limitations of our (only five things at any one time) working memory.</p>
<p>Then you can start to think about the Dynamics of the System: &lt;br&gt;lean and sloppy feedback loops &amp; oscillations, protected areas, &lt;br&gt;processes, flows and stores, black boxes, goal setting and goal-chasing behaviours, &lt;br&gt;rules and regulations, forces of attraction and repulsion, incentives and disincentives, limits to growth, tragedies of the commons, etc.</p>
<p>Then you can 'Wind the handle' to: explore, model, assess and predict the emergent behaviour patterns and assess the systems viability (very important).</p>
<p>Because this is all based on native cognitive abilities which we all have as our birthright - every aspect of this approach can be experienced as a simple fun curious creative (eureka buzz) game, with no need for specialist vocabulary or prior expertise in any of these concepts.</p>
<p>Everyone can do this. We just need to practice. &lt;br&gt;</p>","John Evans",186769563
